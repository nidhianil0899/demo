1. Difference between Block storage & Object Storage ?
Ans: Block storage will take any file apart into individual data blocks. 
It stores the blocks like data's separated pieces. All data's pieces contain the distinct address. Hence it does not require being stored within any file structure.
Object storage will take data's each piece and makes it as any object. Data will be stored in the isolated storehouses. It is bundled with related metadata and a specific identifier.

2. Difference between static website & dynamic website ?
Ans: On a static website, individual webpages include static content. They might also contain client-side scripts. By contrast, a dynamic website relies on server-side processing.

3. What are the naming rules ?
Ans: Be unique within the chosen AWS Region and Availability Zone.
Be no more than 3â€“63 characters long, including the suffix.
Consists only of lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens (-).
Begin and end with a letter or number.
Cannot be formatted as an IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.1).

4. What is the major resource of S3 Bucket ?
Ans:The major resource of an S3 bucket is Simple Storage Service, it provide scalable object storage for various types of data, such as images, videos, documents, backups
and application data.

5. Why do we need to host static websites instead of dynamic websites ?
Ans: Advantages over hosting dynamic websites are as follows:-
Cost-effectiveness: Static websites typically require fewer resources to host compared to dynamic websites.
Simplicity: Static websites are simpler to set up and maintain compared to dynamic websites. 
Performance: Static websites served through a CDN like CloudFront benefit from edge caching, which helps reduce latency and improve performance for users accessing
the website from different geographic locations.

6. What is versioning & Why do we need versioning ?
Ans: Versioning in AWS refers to the feature provided by services like Amazon S3, which allows you to keep multiple versions of an object 
(such as files or data) in the same bucket.
When versioning is enabled for an S3 bucket, every time you upload, copy, or delete an object, a new version of that object is created instead of overwriting the existing version.
Data protection and recovery: Versioning helps protect your data from accidental deletion or overwrites.
Immutable storage/ Unchanging storage: With versioning enabled, object versions in S3 are immutable/unchangable by default.
Rollbacks and experimentation: Versioning enables you to experiment with changes to objects without the risk of permanently altering or losing data. 

7. What are the objects and types of objects that we are uploading into the S3 Bucket ?
Ans: An object is a fundamental storage unit that contains data and metadata.
When you upload data to an S3 bucket, you are essentially uploading objects.
Some common types of objects that are uploaded into S3 buckets in AWS:
Files:  Files can include documents, images, videos, audio files, archives, logs, configuration files, etc. 
HTML Pages, Binary Data,Database Backups,Log Files
Machine Images: Images of virtual machines or servers (e.g., Amazon Machine Images - AMIs) 
can be uploaded as objects to S3 for creating EC2 instances or for sharing with other AWS accounts.

8. Why is MFA Delete important in S3 Bucket object level ?
Ans: Prevention of Accidental Deletion: MFA Delete helps prevent accidental deletion of objects by requiring an additional authentication factor.
